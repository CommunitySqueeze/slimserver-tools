* SlimServer Plugin Builder
======================================================================

This tool allows you to build a SlimServer 7.0+ compatible plugin package.

The basic layout of a plugin is as follows:

topdir/
	install.xml
	strings.txt
	lib/
	lib/Path/To/Modules.pm

All files listed above are mandatory.

Additionally, one may have the following files, 
which are referred to by install.xml:

	bin/
	HTML/
	convert.conf

All files in the topdir/ will be bundled into a .zip file, which is then
installable via the SlimServer Web Interface. A '.par' file will be created
from the perl modules in your lib/ path, which will pull in the appropriate
dependencies.

======================================================================

* Please run 'perl Makefile.PL' to install the necessary dependencies.

* If you wish to install these tools system-wide, run 'make install'

Usage: ./bin/create-slimserver-plugin

	--plugindir <dir>
		This must point to the top level directory where your plugin is.

	--slimserverdir <dir>

		This must point to the top level of your SlimServer directory.
